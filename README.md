## Posts

This is a mern stack app as a CRUD and built as a twitter like app.

This repository serves as the back-end part of the app and
is designed using Node JS.

This app was designed and built by myself and serves as an example of
a side project which I'm currently working on.

The frontend can be found at: https://github.com/RyanG91/posts-frontend.

### Current features:
* Create posts
* Delete posts
* Edit posts
* Created at date
* Likes counter
* Dislikes counter

### Future features:
* Author of posts
* Tests
* Potential deployment (Database is currently local)

These future features may change over time if they are implemented and
if I come up with other ideas which could expand the app further.
